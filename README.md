# California Coast Disability Access
![beachWheelchair](img/beachWheelchair.jpg)
## Project Description
This project is the culminating product of GEOG 458 at the University of Washington. It includes 2 web maps utilizing various coding components including HTML, JavaScript, CSS as well as more specific tools such as QGIS, leaflet, and jquery. The web maps contain key map elements like scales, legends, and zoom control. Both web maps also employ a fixed container to the left for use as a dashboard/directory of sorts also permitting back and forth traversal.
## Project Goal
The purpose of this web application is to inform and assist:
- **To inform** people about the current status of disability access along the California coast in the form of numbers. Through providing statistics by county we hope to convey the large amount of room for improvement left to be made and in what areas are we currently far behind.
- **To assist** people in finding disability accessible beach access points in California by county including several useful characteristics about the access point.
- **Overall Message:** The end goal is to improve the number of beach access points that are disability accessible to 100%. Now, none of these counties even come close to a 100% standard and it might seem unrealistic anywhere in the near future. But the intention here is to emphasize a point of equity and re-enforce equitable ideals as we progress in society. On that note, I will finsih by saying that when devloping infrastructure **for the public** it is vital that we assess and ensure that it is truly accessible to ***ALL* of the public**.
